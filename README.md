# open_data_portal_crawler
***Technologies used: Python, Javascript*** | These scripts were written for the usability of the open data portal project at McGill University.

## How it works?
- Crawlers (**run.js** and **getAside.js**) scrap the metadata of open data available on the Canadian open data portal and generate .json files (e.g. art.json and overall.json) with the metadata.
- The metadata crawled from the web will be analysed in python files.
