# open_data_portal_crawler
These sciriptes were wrote for the usability of open data portal project at McGill university.
- Crawlers (run.js and getAside js) scrap the metadata of open data available on Canadian open data portal and generate .json files (e.g. art.json and overall.json) with the metadata.
- The metadata crawled from the web will be analysed in python files.
